# Advanced HTML5 Charting Library

An ambitious project to build a high-performance charting library similar to TradingView.

## Features

- HTML5 Canvas-based rendering for maximum performance
- Multiple chart types (candlestick, area)
- Technical indicators (SMA, EMA, etc.)
- Interactive zooming and panning
- Customizable timeframes

## Project Structure

- `src/components/` - React components for the chart and UI
- `src/context/` - React context for chart state management
- `src/utils/` - Chart rendering and calculation utilities
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/data/` - Sample data generation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

## Extending the Library

The library is designed to be extended in several ways:

1. **New Chart Types**: Add new rendering functions in `chartRenderer.ts`
2. **Custom Indicators**: Implement new indicators in the frontend
3. **Data Sources**: Connect to different data providers by modifying data fetching logic

## Performance Considerations

- Canvas-based rendering for optimal performance
- Efficient data processing algorithms
- Optimized rendering of large datasets
- Viewport-based rendering to handle large timeframes

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement zoom and pan functionality
- [ ] Add volume profile
- [ ] Add more technical indicators
- [ ] Implement drawing tools
- [ ] Add multi-pane support for separate indicators
- [ ] Implement WebSocket support for real-time data
